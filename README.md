# Elderberry Music Player
 A bare bones music player for low resolution devices, made in Love2D!<br>

## About
This is just a simple music player, featuring queued playback, file navigation, navigable playback and more. I wrote it in less than 24 hours, so don't expect perfection.
## Usage
This program requires the use of LOVE2D. I may make a standalone release soon.
Upon opening the program, you'll (most likely) be prompted with a popup telling you to add some music to a given folder. Once you add music, if it's [supported by LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/wiki/Audio_Formats), it will show up in the list after restarting the program. While hovering over a song, you can press left and right to switch between Play Now and Queue mode (indicated by icons on the left.) To start your queue, start any other song.<br>

You can also add custom album art to any song by making a file called `/path/to/song_with.extension.png`, for example, `/music/test.mp3.png`.<br>

## Other notes
Just some other stuff about Elderberry Music Player I thought i'd clear up:
### Why "Elderberry"?
This music player isnt actually it's own singular project. Rather, it's a music player I made with another project in mind. Said project is called Elderberry for multiple reasons, the main two being because A: small, B: chaotic mess of branches (a.k.a. wires)
### Can I use this for my own project?
Absolutely!!!! No questions asked!!! Have fun!!! Hell, send me photos!!! @damian-is-silly.xyz on Bluesky!!!!!!
### I have a feature reque-
# GET OUT!!!!
### I made a custom feature for this myself! Can you add it?
First of all, congratulations on managing to navigate my spaghetti code.
Secondly, sure! Make a pull request and I'll take a look.
